It's written in C++ and the image manipulation is done through shaders using the [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) API. The GUI is written using the [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library.

Thanks to [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) for the amazing Vulkan tutorial and to github user [planetpratik](https://github.com/planetpratik) for getting me to understand how to integrate ImGui with Vulkan.
